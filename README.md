Hi, I’m @Sheldon-Cole

I'm currently a Security Technician for a school district and double as the backup Network Administrator.

Certifications:
- CCNA
- CompTIA A+

I'm learning Docker, K8s and Ansible currently with a dabble of WDS-MDT.

For now, I've created this to store small scripts I've written to help with my daily life at work. 

Best,

Sheldon
